# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The League Management MVP extends the existing team-management-mvp to support basic multi-team coordination within a single league. This represents the natural next step for users who manage multiple teams or want to coordinate activities across teams in their organization.

The system builds on the existing foundation by adding a League entity that can contain multiple teams, basic division organization, and cross-team scheduling capabilities. The focus is on extending the current single-team experience to handle 2-5 teams within one league, while maintaining all existing functionality and user experience patterns.

This MVP specifically targets league administrators who currently manage multiple separate teams and want to coordinate schedules, share rosters, and communicate across teams. The scope is intentionally limited to essential multi-team features, deferring advanced capabilities like facility management, tournaments, and complex analytics to future phases.
