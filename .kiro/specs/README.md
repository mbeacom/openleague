**Spec:** Full `league-management-platform/`

**Key Features:**
- Multi-tenant architecture
- White-label customization
- Mobile applications (React Native)
- Advanced analytics (Elasticsearch)
- Microservices extraction

## How to Use These Specs

### For Current Development
1. **Use `league-management-mvp/`** for all current implementation
2. Open `league-management-mvp/tasks.md` and start with Task 1.1
3. Follow the phased approach in the implementation plan

### For Planning and Vision
1. **Reference `league-management-platform/`** for long-term planning
2. Use it to understand the complete vision and architecture
3. Break down future phases into smaller specs as needed

### For Understanding Relationships
- **team-management-mvp** â†’ **league-management-mvp** â†’ **league-management-platform**
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout

## Key Principles

### Incremental Development
- Each phase delivers working software
- Users can adopt new features when ready
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-team users continue working unchanged
- Migration paths provided for each upgrade
- URLs and bookmarks remain functional

### Realistic Scope
- Each phase has clear, achievable goals
- Timeline estimates based on actual development capacity
- Features deferred to appropriate phases

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
- Current `prisma/schema.prisma` contains the full long-term schema
- Only implement models needed for current phase
- Use optional relationships for future features

### Architecture Evolution
- Start with Next.js monolith (current)
- Add complexity only when needed
- Microservices extraction in Phase 3 only

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for current scale (single league, 2-5 teams)
- Add caching and advanced optimizations in later phases
- Mobile-first responsive design throughout

## Questions?

If you're unsure which spec to use:
- **Building features now?** â†’ Use `league-management-mvp/`
- **Planning future work?** â†’ Reference `league-management-platform/`
- **Understanding the vision?** â†’ Read both, starting with MVP

The key is to focus on delivering value incrementally while maintaining the long-term vision.
