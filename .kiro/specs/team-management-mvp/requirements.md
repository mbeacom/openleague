# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The openleague MVP is a web-based platform designed to simplify sports team management for team administrators and members. The system replaces fragmented communication tools (spreadsheets, group chats, email chains) with a centralized solution that answers the fundamental questions: "Who, What, When, and Where?" for a single team during a specific season.

The MVP focuses on four core capabilities: user authentication and team foundation, roster management with email invitations, game and practice scheduling with calendar views, and availability tracking through an RSVP system. The platform prioritizes a mobile-first, admin-centric experience with a clean, functional interface.
