# Task 10 Completion Summary: RSVP and Attendance Tracking

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete RSVP and attendance tracking system for the openleague MVP. This feature allows team members to indicate their availability for events and enables admins to view attendance summaries.

## Implemented Components

### 1. RSVP Server Actions (`lib/actions/rsvp.ts`)
- Created `updateRSVP` Server Action that:
  - Accepts `eventId` and `status` (GOING, NOT_GOING, MAYBE)
  - Validates user is a team member
  - Creates or updates RSVP records using Prisma upsert
  - Revalidates relevant pages for instant UI updates
  - Returns success/error responses with proper error handling

### 2. RSVP Button Component (`components/features/events/RSVPButtons.tsx`)
- Client Component with three action buttons:
  - **Going** (green, success color)
  - **Maybe** (amber, warning color)
  - **Not Going** (red, error color)
- Features:
  - Optimistic UI updates using React's `useOptimistic` hook
  - Highlighted selected status with contained variant
  - Responsive layout (stacked on mobile, row on desktop)
  - Touch-friendly 48px minimum height
  - Disabled state during submission
  - Icons for visual clarity

### 3. Attendance View Component (`components/features/events/AttendanceView.tsx`)
- Admin-only component displaying:
  - **Summary Cards**: Visual count of Going, Maybe, Not Going, No Response
  - **Detailed Lists**: Member names grouped by RSVP status
  - Color-coded chips for each status category
  - Responsive grid layout (2 columns on mobile, 4 on desktop)
- Mobile-optimized with:
  - Flexible chip wrapping
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Easy-to-scan format

### 4. RSVP Reminder Email System
#### Email Template (`lib/email/templates.ts`)
- Created `sendRSVPReminderEmail` function:
  - Personalized greeting with user name
  - Event details (type, date, location, opponent)
  - Clear call-to-action button
  - Direct link to event RSVP page
  - Both HTML and plain text versions

#### Reminder Logic
- Created `sendRSVPReminders` function:
  - Queries events happening in 48 hours (47-48 hour window)
  - Finds all RSVPs with NO_RESPONSE status
  - Sends individual reminder emails
  - Continues on individual failures (doesn't block other reminders)

#### Cron Job Setup
- Created API route: `app/api/cron/rsvp-reminders/route.ts`
  - GET endpoint for scheduled execution
  - Optional authorization with CRON_SECRET env variable
  - Error handling and logging
  - Returns success/failure status

- Created `vercel.json` configuration:
  - Scheduled to run every hour: `"0 * * * *"`
  - Automatically triggers reminder checks
  - Can be customized for different schedules

### 5. Integration with Event Detail Page
Updated `components/features/events/EventDetail.tsx`:
- Integrated RSVPButtons component
- Shows current user's RSVP status
- Displays AttendanceView for admins only
- Passes all required props (event data, user role, current user ID)

Updated `app/(dashboard)/events/[id]/page.tsx`:
- Simplified to use EventDetail component with full event data
- Passes current user ID for RSVP status lookup
- Removed duplicate RSVP/Attendance components

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 7.1 ✅
- WHEN a member views an event THEN the system SHALL display RSVP options: Going, Not Going, Maybe
- **Implementation**: RSVPButtons component with three distinct buttons

### Requirement 7.2 ✅
- WHEN a member selects an RSVP status THEN the system SHALL save the response immediately
- **Implementation**: Server Action with optimistic updates for instant feedback

### Requirement 7.3 ✅
- WHEN a member changes their RSVP THEN the system SHALL update the status and reflect it in the attendance view
- **Implementation**: Upsert operation in database, revalidation triggers re-render

### Requirement 7.4 ✅
- WHEN an admin views event attendance THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing who is Going, Not Going, Maybe, and No Response
- **Implementation**: AttendanceView component with summary counts and detailed lists

### Requirement 7.5 ✅
- WHEN viewing attendance on mobile THEN the system SHALL display the information in an easy-to-scan format
- **Implementation**: Responsive grid layout with flexible chip wrapping

### Requirement 7.7 ✅
- WHEN a member has not responded THEN the system SHALL send a reminder email 48 hours before the event
- **Implementation**: Cron job checking events in 48-hour window, sending reminders to NO_RESPONSE users

### Requirement 9.5 ✅
- WHEN a user has not responded to an event THEN the system SHALL send a reminder email 48 hours before the event
- **Implementation**: Same as 7.7 - automated reminder system

## Technical Highlights

### Optimistic Updates
- Used React 19's `useOptimistic` hook for instant UI feedback
- Provides smooth user experience without waiting for server response
- Automatically reverts on error

### Mobile-First Design
- Touch-friendly button sizes (48px minimum)
- Responsive layouts (stacked on mobile, row on desktop)
- Flexible chip wrapping for member lists
- Clear visual hierarchy with color coding

### Security & Authorization
- All Server Actions verify user authentication
- Team membership validation before RSVP updates
- Admin-only attendance view
- Optional cron secret for API route protection

### Email Deliverability
- HTML and plain text versions for all emails
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Fallback text links
- Personalized content with user names

### Scalability
- Efficient database queries with Prisma
- Batch email sending capability
- Error handling that doesn't block other operations
- Revalidation for cache management

## Environment Variables Required

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Optional: For securing the cron endpoint
CRON_SECRET="your-random-secret-key"
```

## Deployment Notes

### Vercel Cron
The `vercel.json` file configures automatic cron execution on Vercel:
- Runs every hour
- No additional setup required on Vercel
- Free tier includes cron jobs

### Alternative Cron Services
If not using Vercel, you can use external services like:
- **Cron-job.org**: Free HTTP cron service
- **EasyCron**: Scheduled HTTP requests
- **AWS EventBridge**: For AWS deployments

Configure them to call:
```
GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/rsvp-reminders
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **RSVP Flow**:
   - View event as member
   - Click each RSVP button (Going, Maybe, Not Going)
   - Verify optimistic update
   - Refresh page to confirm persistence

2. **Attendance View**:
   - View event as admin
   - Verify summary counts match actual RSVPs
   - Check member names appear in correct categories
   - Test on mobile and desktop

3. **Email Reminders**:
   - Create event 48 hours in future
   - Leave some RSVPs as NO_RESPONSE
   - Trigger cron manually: `curl https://your-domain.com/api/cron/rsvp-reminders`
   - Verify emails sent to correct recipients

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for RSVP Server Action
- Integration tests for RSVP flow
- Email template rendering tests
- Cron job logic tests

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Push Notifications**: Browser push for RSVP reminders
2. **Bulk RSVP**: Admin can RSVP on behalf of members
3. **RSVP History**: Track RSVP changes over time
4. **Attendance Analytics**: Show attendance patterns
5. **Custom Reminder Times**: Allow admins to configure reminder timing
6. **SMS Reminders**: Alternative to email for urgent reminders
