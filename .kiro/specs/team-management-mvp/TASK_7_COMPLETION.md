# Task 7: Invitation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete invitation system that allows team admins to invite players via email, with automatic team membership upon signup.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 7.1 Create invitation Server Actions ✅
**Files Created:**
- `lib/actions/invitations.ts`

**Implementation:**
- `sendInvitation()` - Sends invitations with unique tokens, 7-day expiration
- Checks if email already has account and adds them directly to team if so
- Prevents duplicate invitations for the same email/team
- `getTeamInvitations()` - Fetches all invitations for a team (admin only)
- `resendInvitation()` - Regenerates token and expiration for expired invitations
- All functions include proper authorization checks (admin only)
- Uses cryptographically secure random tokens (32 bytes hex)

### 7.2 Build email invitation system ✅
**Files Created:**
- `lib/email/client.ts` - Mailchimp Transactional client configuration
- `lib/email/templates.ts` - Email templates for invitations
- `types/mailchimp.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations for Mailchimp package

**Implementation:**
- `sendInvitationEmail()` - Sends invitation email with unique link
- `sendExistingUserNotification()` - Notifies existing users when added to team
- Professional HTML and plain text email templates
- Includes team name, inviter name, and clear call-to-action buttons
- Integrated email sending into invitation Server Actions
- Graceful error handling (doesn't fail operation if email fails)

**Package Installed:**
- `@mailchimp/mailchimp_transactional@1.0.59`

### 7.3 Create invitation acceptance flow ✅
**Files Created:**
- `app/api/invitations/[token]/route.ts` - API route for invitation links

**Files Modified:**

- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` - Pre-fills email and team info from invitation

**Implementation:**

- Redirects to signup page with pre-filled information
- Signup action automatically adds user to team as MEMBER
- Updates invitation status to ACCEPTED after successful signup
- Handles expired invitations gracefully
- Email field is disabled when coming from invitation link

### 7.4 Build invitation management UI ✅
**Files Created:**
- `components/features/roster/InvitationManager.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(dashboard)/roster/page.tsx` - Integrated invitation manager

**Implementation:**
- Form to send new invitations with email input
- List of all invitations with status badges (Pending/Accepted/Expired)
- Color-coded status chips (warning/success/error)
- Resend button for expired invitations
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile, horizontal on desktop)
- Real-time feedback with success/error alerts
- Only visible to team admins
- Shows invitation creation date

## Key Features

### Security
- Cryptographically secure random tokens (32 bytes)
- 7-day expiration on invitations
- Admin-only authorization checks on all operations
- Tokens are single-use (marked ACCEPTED after signup)

### User Experience
- Existing users are added directly without signup
- Pre-filled signup form from invitation link
- Clear status indicators for invitations
- Easy resend for expired invitations
- Professional email templates with branding

### Error Handling
- Validates invitation tokens and expiration
- Prevents duplicate invitations
- Graceful email sending failures (doesn't block operations)
- Clear error messages for users

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY="your-mailchimp-transactional-api-key"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@openleague.app"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Used for invitation links
```

## Database Schema
Uses existing `Invitation` model from Prisma schema:
- `id`, `email`, `token`, `status`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Relations to `Team` and `User` (inviter)
- Unique constraint on `token`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Send invitation to new email (should create invitation and send email)
2. Send invitation to existing user email (should add directly to team)
3. Click invitation link (should redirect to signup with pre-filled data)
4. Complete signup from invitation (should auto-add to team)
5. Try expired invitation link (should show error)
6. Resend expired invitation (should generate new token)
7. Verify admin-only access to invitation features

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 4.1: Email invitations with unique links
- ✅ 4.2: Invitation acceptance redirects to signup
- ✅ 4.3: Auto-add to team after signup
- ✅ 4.4: View pending invitations
- ✅ 4.5: Check for existing accounts
- ✅ 4.6: 7-day expiration and resend capability
- ✅ 9.4: Email notifications for invitations

## Next Steps
Task 7 is complete. The invitation system is fully functional and ready for use. The next task in the implementation plan is Task 8: Create event scheduling system.
