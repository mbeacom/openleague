# Product Overview

openleague is a free platform for managing sports teams, leagues, and clubs. It replaces chaotic spreadsheets, group chats, and email chains with a single source of truth for team management.

## MVP Focus: Single Team Management

The MVP targets team managers (admins) who need to answer "Who, What, When, and Where?" for their team.

### Core Features

1. **User & Team Foundation**: Email/password auth, team creation for specific seasons, two roles (Admin and Member)
2. **Roster Management**: Email invitations, basic roster with player info and contacts
3. **Scheduling & Calendar**: Create games/practices with date, time, location, opponent, and notes
4. **Availability Tracking**: RSVP system (Going/Not Going/Maybe) with attendance view for admins

### Key Principles

- **Admin-first experience**: Build from the team manager's perspective
- **No frills**: Clean, fast, functional UI without complex animations
- **Mobile-first**: Must work seamlessly on mobile browsers
- **Single team focus**: Perfect the single team experience before expanding

### Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP

- Payments & registration
- Multi-team/league-level views
- Stats tracking (goals, assists, etc.)
- Public-facing websites
- In-app chat/messaging (use email notifications instead)
